# MyBOQ / ME Go bank statement PDF to CSV script

This is a pipeline for converting MyBOQ and ME Go bank statement PDF files into a CSV format for easier finance accounting. It does the following:

1. Convert the PDF file using the `pdftotext` tool into to a structured text file
2. Extract transaction data from the text file with a custom Python script and convert it into a CSV format which can then be copied to a spreadsheet for further reference.

**Before: Raw exported PDF transaction data**

## Usage

Execute the convert_pdf_statement_to_csv.sh Bash script in a terminal. Change 'example-bank-statement.pdf' into the name of the bank statement file to convert, and 2024 to the year the statement was introduced.

```sh
./convert_pdf_statement_to_csv.sh -f 'example-bank-statement.pdf' -y 2024
```

Before running the script for the 1st time, mark it as executable first using `chmod +x convert_pdf_statement_to_csv.sh`.

### Optional flags

- `-r`, `--reverse`: Order the transactions list by their dates in descending order.
- `-l`, `--legacy`: Process the bank statement using ME Go's pre-2024 transaction format of (debit) (credit) (balance) instead of (debit or credit) (balance), and a date format of 1 Jan instead of 01-Jan.
- `-d`, `--debug`: Toggle transaction debugging output.

e.g. to debug, use

```sh
./convert_pdf_statement_to_csv.sh -f 'bank-statement.pdf' -y 2024 -d
```

### Testing

This repo comes with a sample PDF statement text file which can be used to test the Python script.

```sh
python3 convert_pdf_statement_text_to_csv.py -f "example-pdf-statement.txt" -y 2024 -d
```
