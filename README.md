# Script to convert PDF bank statement text data into CSV

Some banks are only able to export bank transactions in PDF form via the statements, as they do not have a CSV export option. This poses issues when I want to copy this data over into my spreadsheets for finance accounting purposes, as I previously would've needed to manually transcribe each transaction one by one.

There is a Linux program called `pdftotext` which can export the contents of the PDF to a text file, which is well structured. But as the transaction description may be spread out over multiple lines, using regex to convert it to a CSV isn't possible.

This script aims to extract the desired transaction data from the exported PDF text file and convert it into a CSV format which can then be copied to a spreadsheet.
